										We came to thalambur, with a <b>honest</b> intent to provide a happy education for our daughter, with <b>The School</b>  <br>
										<b>We</b> have never asked my daughter to do something, instead when she does something i ask what it is. She tells me a story out of it that i enjoy. It will be very creative. 
										<br><b>She</b> takes crayon and scribbles, and show to us. We ask what that is, she will say "square maathiri iruku", "fish maathiri iruku". We don't force her to draw something, we help her to enjoy doing things.
										<br><b>We</b> take 5 fruit cards and ask her, "now we will tell it wrong". The game is to tell a different name than the fruit, but only use names from the 5 cards. This way she not only remembers the name for the fruit, but also the names she has exhausted in the past and the ones that are remaining that should be used. Adhistri enjoys it a lot.

									Dear sir/madam,<br>
									We heartfully want to get our daughter affiliated with "The School". It's not yet another option that we are trying. We didn't put her to any other school when she turned 3, primarily we are aspiring to put her in The school. We might not have all the answers and clues to be eligible to get a seat. But our intent and aspiration is aligned with what we learned about The school. Requesting you to kindly consider our request.
